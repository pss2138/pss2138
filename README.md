## ðŸ’¬ My Work Style
" Mapping User Scenarios Before Touching Code "

Every product requirement starts from users' actions. First user action initiates an event to trigger continuous events within the program to accomplish the purpose of the scenario requirement - it is called **"event chain"**. Defining user scenarios to approach the business goal should be the first step in designing products.

```
Defined user scenarios
-> essential UI components & supporting functions 
-> API patterns 
-> Back-End logics & Database structures 
-> Response to the end user
```
Planning for me isnâ€™t just about speed - itâ€™s about building systems anyone can understand.

Whether itâ€™s a new developer or a CEO, the structure document should be transparent and intentional in a remote environment where the viewer can understand without in-person instruction.
