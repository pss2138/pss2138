## ðŸ’¬ My Work Style
```
Mapping User Scenarios Before Touching Code
```
Every product requirements start from users' actions. First user action initiates an event to triger continuous events within the program to accomplish the purpose of the scenario requirement - it is called **"event chain"**. Defining user scenarios to approach business goal should be the first step to design product for such matter.

```
Defined user scenarios
-> essential UI components & supporting functions 
-> API patterns 
-> Back -End logics & Database structures 
-> Response to the end user
```
Planning for me isnâ€™t just about speed - itâ€™s about building systems anyone can understand.

Whether itâ€™s a new developer or a CEO, the structure docuemnt should be transparent and intentional in a remote condition where the viewer can understand without in-person instruction.
